## What is Data Engineering?

Data Engineering is the development, implementation, and maintenance of systems and processes that take in raw data (generate and ingest), transforms it and produce high-quality consistent information that supports downstream use cases - (I'll come up with analogy in the oil industry to drive this idea home.

### Data Engineering Lifecycle: The stages of data engineering lifecyle are as follows:
- Generation
-  Storage
-  Ingestion
-  Transformation
-  Serving

  There is also the notion of undercurrents - these are critical themes and concepts around the end-to-end lifecycle. These include the following
- Security
- Data Management
- DataOps
- Data Architecture
- Orchestration
- Software Engineering

## Concept of Data Maturity: 
Data Maturity is the progression from basic towards advanced data utilization, capabilities, and integration across the organization. An Organization's Data Maturity is not a factor of the age or revenue of a company. Typically companies fall within one or more of these stages on their data maturity evolution
- `Starting with Data`
- `Scaliing with Data`
- `Leading with Data`

In general, the role of a data engineer evolves from a generalist to a specialist as an organization advances through these stages of the data maturity model.

## Business Responsibilites of a Data Engineer
- Understand how to scope and gather business and product requirements
- Know how to communicate with nontechnical and technical people
- Understand the foundations of Agile, DevOps and DataOps
- Control Costs
- Learn Continuously

A successful data engineer always zooms out to understand the big picture and how to achieve outsized value for the business.

## Technical Responsibilities of a Data Engineer
At a high level, data engineers must understand how to build architectures that optimize performance and cost, using using off-the-shelf and proprietary components. The primary languages of data engineering are 
- `SQL`
- `Python`
- `Java` or `Scala` and `Bash`
